			<h3>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee
					Stoney) and
					Julius Mathison Turing.</li>
				<li><strong>1926</strong> - Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset. His first day of term
					coincided
					with the 1926 General Strike. Turing was so determined not to miss his first day of school that he
					cycled the
					97km from his home in Southampton. His teachers worried that he leaned too heavily towards maths and
					science, at
					the expense of the classics. The headmaster wrote to his parents: "If he is to be solely a
					scientific
					specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school".</li>
				<li><strong>1927</strong> - At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with Albert Einstein's work and
					extrapolated
					Einstein's questioning of Newton's Law of Motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.
				</li>
				<li><strong>1930</strong> - Turing's close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine
					tuberculosis. Turing remounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.</li>
				<li><strong>1931</strong> - Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
				<li><strong>1935</strong> - Turing proves the central limit theorem in his dissertation and is made a
					fellow at
					King's at the age of just 22.</li>
				<li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper <i>On computable Numbers and and Application to
						the
						Entscheidungsproblem</i> in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known as
					the Turing
					Machine. This was an idealised computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical
					computation that
					can be represented as an algorithm.</li>
				<li><strong>1936-1938</strong> - Turing spent time at Princeton in the US studying under Alonzo Church.
					There he
					started to study cryptology as well as mathematics. In 1938, he received his Ph.D; his dissertation
					was called
					Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and introduced original logic and relative computing.</li>
				<li><strong>September 1938</strong> - Turing started to work part-time at the Government Code and Cypher
					School.
				</li>
				<li><strong>1939</strong> - The day after war is declared in September 1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley
					Park.
					There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent
					by Germans
					using their Enigma machines. The Bombe built on a machine that the Polish had already made, called
					the Bomba
					Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techiques to optimise the trial of different possiblities in
					the
					code-breaking process using probability.
				</li>
				<li><strong>1941</strong> - Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and
					cryptanalyst.
					Shortly after, Turing had second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was homosexual.</li>
				<li><strong>1942</strong> - Turing sent to the US as part of an intelligence collaboration. He shared
					what he
					knew
					about Enigma in return for being allowed to inspect the speech encryption system being set up to
					allow
					conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turing was somewhat dismissive of US cryptanalysis,
					believing
					the
					Americans to rely too heavily on machinery instead of thought.</li>
				<li><strong>1941-43</strong> - Turing and colleagues manage to break the more complicated German Naval
					Enigma
					system. This is extremely helpful for the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it could help
					them
					avoid
					the fearsome German U-boats, which had been responsible for sinking more than 700 Allied ships with
					2.3
					million
					tons of vital cargo.</li>
				<li><strong>1945</strong> - Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory where he worked on developing
					an
					electronic digital stored-program computing machine that would later become the ACE (Automatic
					Computing
					Engine). By 1946, he had a finished proposal for the computer, but NPL did not have the resources to
					turn it
					into reality.</li>
				<li><strong>1947</strong> - Turing returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. The Pilot ACE was built
					in his
					absence and executed its first program on 10 May 1950.</li>
				<li><strong>1949</strong> - Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester
					University,
					working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers - the Manchester Mark1. He also
					epxlored
					the problem of artifical intelligence and proposed an experiment (in his seminal paper <i>Computing
						Machinery
						and Intelligence)</i> which became that attempted to define a standard for machine intelligence,
					which
					would
					later become known as the Turing test. The core idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if
					a human
					interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. Turing also worked
					with a
					his
					former colleague D G Champernowne on a chess program for a computer that did not exist yet.</li>
				<li><strong>1952</strong> - Without a computer powerful enough to execute his chess program, Turing
					played a
					game
					in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour to perform each move. The program lost
					to
					Turing's
					colleague Alick Glennie, but won against Champernowne's wife.</li>
				<li><strong>January 1952</strong> - Turing meets a man called Arnold Murray and invites him over to his
					house.
					Murray visits Turing's house on a number of occasions, staying the night. Murray later helps an
					accomplice
					break
					into Turing's house. Turing reports the crime and admits having a sexual relationship with Murray.
					Homosexual
					acts are illegal in the UK and so both were charged with gross indecency. Turing is given the choice
					of
					being
					imprisoned or chemically castrated with oestrogen hormone injections. He chooses the latter.
					Turing's
					conviction
					means his security clearance is removed which means he is barred from his cryptopgraphic consultancy
					for the
					British government.</li>
				<li><strong>June 1954</strong> - Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem
					finds
					that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with
					cyanide.
				</li>
				<li><strong>1986</strong> - A play, Breaking the Code, about Alan's life and work opens in the West End
					with
					Derek
					Jacobi playing Alan.</li>
				<li><strong>1998</strong> - A Blue Plaque is unveiled at Turing's birthplace in Warrington Crescent,
					London
					(now
					the Colonnade Hotel).</li>
				<li><strong>2001</strong> - A statue of Alan Turing is unveiled in Sackville Gardens, Manchester.</li>
				<li><strong>2004</strong> - A memorial plaque is unveiled at his last home in Wilmslow, Cheshire.</li>
				<li><strong>2007</strong> - A slate sculpture of Alan Turning is unveiled at Bletchley Park.</li>
				<li><strong>2009</strong> - In response to a petition signed by thousands of people, the Prime Minister,
					Gordon
					Brown makes a public apology saying the treatment of Alan Turing was "appalling".</li>
